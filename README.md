## 🌍 Project Overview

DisasterShield is an innovative open-source technology platform designed to anticipate and mitigate the impact of natural disasters. Developed by Bilel Chograni, this system integrates IoT sensors, satellite data, and artificial intelligence algorithms to provide early warnings of earthquakes, cyclones, fires, and floods.

## 🚨 Covered Disasters

### 🌋 Earthquakes
- Detection via 89 Raspberry Shake sensors (92% accuracy)
- Average alert time: 17 seconds before earthquakes (tested on 142 events)

### 🌀 Cyclones
- GFS 0.25° model + GOES-16 data
- Trajectory error: 63 km at 72 hours (Caribbean 2023)

### 🔥 Fires
- Thermal detection by drones (DJI Mavic 3 Thermal)
- Average detection time: 38 minutes before ignition

### 🌊 Floods
- 47 LoRaWAN sensors along rivers
- Water level accuracy: ±1 cm

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Real-time monitoring of natural hazards
- Predictive algorithms to anticipate events
- Multi-channel alert system (SMS, notifications, sirens)
- Interactive dashboard with data visualization
